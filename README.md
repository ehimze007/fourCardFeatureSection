# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, one needs a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.
